===== Aims =====

To examine the use of the Java platform for the development of client-server and enterprise computing applications. 
===== Learning Outcomes =====

After completing this module you will be able to:
  * describe the correct use of objects, classes, interfaces, exceptions, and collections.
  * describe the major infrastructure features of an enterprise application, the java APIs that give access to these and the typical architectures used in enterprise application development. 
  * identify and describe common software design patterns used in the implementation of enterprise architectures
  * design and implement an enterprise computing application with a web interface using the Grails framework. 
===== Module Content: Lectures =====

  * The keys to object-oriented programming on the Java platform: objects, composition & inheritance, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, threaded execution, exception handlers, java beans.
  * Enterprise infrastructure: TCP/IP and sockets; RMI; Web and HTTP; SQL and RDBMS. An introduction to the Java APIs to support these: sockets; RMI; Servlets and JSP; JDBC.
  * Software design patterns and system architecture. The three-tier enterprise architecture: presentation tier and web presentation, business tier and enterprise integration tier. The web container and enterprise java bean container.
