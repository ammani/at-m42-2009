====== Introducing the Java Platform and the Module ======

  * A Taste of things to Come 
  * Introduction to the Java Platform Java
  * Software Design Patterns
  * Client-Server Architectures
  * Module Plan
  * Assumed Co/Pre-Requisites
===== Introducing the Java Platform =====

Will cover Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE 5) 
also known as Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5
and Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE).
Only J2SE required for projects and exercises.
Design Goals for Java
What Java Isn’t
What About GUIs?
Software Design Patterns
Popularised by the book: Design Patterns by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (Addison Wesley).
The are recurring forms of software development that you can capture at a low level and reuse across dissimilar applications.
We shall see examples of several of these in the module and you are required to recognise and document those that occur in your project.
Client-Server Architectures
Examples of Architectures
Single tier systems
Two tier systems
Three tier systems
Multi-tier systems
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications

Single Tier System
Two-Tier System
Three-Tier System
Three-Tier System: With Web Tier
Examples:
CGI application
Lightweight framework
Multi-Tier System
Multi-Tier J2EE
Peer-to-Peer System
Module Plan
Part 1: The Essence of Java
Nine lectures
Part 2: Client Server Programming
Four lectures
Part 3: Enterprise Computing in Java 
Five lectures
Part 4: Assessment Week
Seminars
Project work
End-of-module test


Co & Pre-Requisites and Other Notes
Knowledge of C Programming Syntax is an advantage. 
The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is used in this course. 
Access to Eckel (available on-line) will be a definite plus.
For seminars and project, most of the currently available information is on the web. Unfortunately this means that quality varies!
I hope to be able to distribute a CD-ROM with all copies of Eckel, Java tutorials, my slides, all the examples and the software tools later this week.
The final test will be “open book”.
